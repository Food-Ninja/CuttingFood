Is a Core an anatomical part of an almond?,No,"No. 

A core is a central part of fruits like apples, but almonds have a pit.",True
Is a Shell an anatomical part of an almond?,Yes,"No. 

A shell is the hard outer covering of a nut, not an almond's anatomical part.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. A shell is indeed an anatomical part of an almond, as it refers to the hard outer covering that encloses the edible seed. The LLM's response is incorrect."
"What is the edibility of an almond's Shell - can it be eaten, should it be avoided or must it be avoided?",MustBeAvoided,Almond shells are **not edible** and should be avoided.,"True 

The LLM answer aligns with the ground truth, as ""not edible"" and ""should be avoided"" convey a similar meaning to ""must be avoided"" in the context of the almond shell's edibility."
Is a Peel an anatomical part of an almond?,No,"No. 

The peel is the outer skin of the almond, not an anatomical part.",True
Is a Stem an anatomical part of an almond?,No,"No. 

Stems are part of the plant, but almonds are the seeds within the fruit of the almond tree.",True
"When cutting an almond, what tool should be used?",Knife,A nutcracker.,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Knife"", but the LLM answer is ""A nutcracker"", which is not the same. While a nutcracker could potentially be used to crack an almond, it's not the most suitable or common tool for cutting an almond, which is typically done with a knife."
"When peeling an almond, what tool should be used?",Nutcracker,A nutcracker or your fingers.,"True 

The LLM answer includes the ground truth answer (nutcracker) as one of the options, and also provides an alternative method (using fingers) that is also a viable way to peel an almond. Therefore, the LLM answer aligns with the ground truth."
Is a Core an anatomical part of an apple?,Yes,No.,False
"What is the edibility of an apple's Core - can it be eaten, should it be avoided or must it be avoided?",ShouldBeAvoided,"It can be eaten, but most people avoid it due to texture and seed hardness.","False 

The LLM answer suggests that the core can be eaten, whereas the ground truth states that it should be avoided. Although the LLM answer mentions that most people avoid it, it does not align with the ground truth that it should be avoided, implying a potential issue with eating the core."
Is a Shell an anatomical part of an apple?,No,"No. 

The shell is a protective outer layer, not an anatomical part of the apple itself.",True
Is a Peel an anatomical part of an apple?,Yes,No. A peel is the outer skin of an apple.,"True 

Although the LLM's answer seems to contradict the ground truth at first, it actually aligns with it. The LLM is correct that a peel is the outer skin of an apple, and the ground truth states that a peel is an anatomical part of an apple. The LLM's answer is providing more specific information about what a peel is, rather than disagreeing with the ground truth."
"What is the edibility of an apple's Peel - can it be eaten, should it be avoided or must it be avoided?",Edible,"Apple peels are edible, but some people prefer to remove them due to texture or pesticide concerns.","True 

The LLM answer aligns with the ground truth that apple peels are edible, while also providing additional context about potential reasons to remove them."
Is a Stem an anatomical part of an apple?,No,"No. 

A stem is a part of the apple tree, not the fruit itself.",True
"When cutting an apple, what tool should be used?",CuttingTool,A knife.,"True

The peel is not an anatomical part of the banana fruit itself, but rather a protective outer layer.","False 

Although the LLM's answer may seem correct in a colloquial sense, the ground truth answer is ""Yes"", a peel is considered an anatomical part of a banana. The LLM's answer is attempting to make a distinction between the peel and the fruit, but in botanical terms, the peel is indeed a part of the banana. Therefore, the LLM's answer does not align with the ground truth."
"What is the edibility of a banana's Peel - can it be eaten, should it be avoided or must it be avoided?",MustBeAvoided,Banana peels are edible but generally **should be avoided** due to their tough texture and bitter taste.,"False 

The LLM answer states that banana peels ""should be avoided"", whereas the ground truth states that they ""must be avoided"". These are different levels of avoidance, with ""must be avoided"" implying a stronger warning, likely due to potential health risks or other concerns. The LLM answer acknowledges that they are edible but advises against eating them due to texture and taste, which does not align with the stronger warning in the ground truth."

"When dicing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,"Often, **coring** or **seeding** is necessary before dicing.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth mentions ""Julienning"" as the cutting task to be executed before dicing, whereas the LLM answer mentions ""coring"" or ""seeding"". Julienning refers to cutting into thin strips, which is a different task than coring or seeding."
"When dicing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" since making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made."
"When dicing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,"The input is the **whole, un-diced fruit or vegetable**.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the form of the input is a ""Stripe"", but the LLM answer describes the input as a ""whole, un-diced fruit or vegetable"". These are two different descriptions, so the LLM answer does not match the ground truth."
"When dicing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,"Dicing produces small, roughly cube-shaped pieces of uniform size.","False 

The LLM answer describes the general outcome of dicing but does not match the specific ground truth provided, which mentions ""1 Cube and 1 Stripe"". The LLM's description of ""small, roughly cube-shaped pieces of uniform size"" aligns with common understanding of dicing but does not account for the ""1 Stripe"" part of the ground truth."
"When cutting a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When cutting a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",exactly 1,More than one.,False

"When slicing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When slicing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" because making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made. The ground truth does not specify an exact number, and the LLM answer is a possible scenario that satisfies the condition of making at least one cut."
"When slicing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Whole or FoodPart,The input is the **whole fruit or vegetable**.,True
"When slicing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 FoodPart and 1 Slice,"It depends on the slicing technique used (dice, julienne, etc.) and the desired size.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that the resulting pieces will be 1 FoodPart and 1 Slice. The LLM answer introduces additional variables (slicing technique and desired size) that are not mentioned in the ground truth, and does not provide a direct answer to the question."
"When snipping a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When snipping a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"False 

The ground truth states ""at least 1"", which means one cut is sufficient, but the LLM answer states ""More than one"", which contradicts the ground truth."
"When snipping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Whole or FoodPart,The input is the **physical object** of the fruit or vegetable.,"False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that the input form is either ""Whole"" or ""FoodPart"", whereas the LLM answer describes the input as a ""physical object""."
"When snipping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 FoodPart and 1 Slice,"It depends on the desired outcome and the tool used. 

There's no single answer for all fruits and vegetables.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that the resulting pieces are 1 FoodPart and 1 Slice. The LLM answer is vague and does not provide a specific form and amount of the resulting pieces, instead stating that it depends on various factors."
"When slivering a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When slivering a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" since making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made."
"When slivering a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Whole or FoodPart,"Whole, unpeeled fruit or vegetable.","True 

The LLM answer ""Whole, unpeeled fruit or vegetable"" aligns with the ground truth ""Whole or FoodPart"" as it specifies a form of the input (whole) that is a subset of the ground truth."
"When slivering a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 FoodPart and 1 Slice,"Thin, long, matchstick-like pieces.","True 

The LLM answer describes the form of the resulting pieces as thin, long, and matchstick-like, which aligns with the concept of a slice. Although it doesn't explicitly state ""1 FoodPart and 1 Slice"", the description implies a sliced or slivered form, which matches the ground truth."
"When sawing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When sawing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",exactly 1,More than one.,False

"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,"**Slicing** 

(to create manageable pieces for mincing)","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth is ""Julienning"", but the LLM answer is ""Slicing"". Although the LLM's reasoning that slicing is done to create manageable pieces for mincing is correct, the specific task that should be executed before mincing, according to the ground truth, is Julienning, which is a cutting technique that involves cutting ingredients into thin strips, typically before mincing."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" since making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,"Whole, peeled fruit or vegetable.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the form of the input is a ""Stripe"", but the LLM answer states that it is a ""Whole, peeled fruit or vegetable"". These are two different forms, so the LLM answer does not match the ground truth."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,"Mincing produces very fine, irregular pieces.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that mincing results in 1 cube and 1 stripe. The LLM answer describes the pieces as ""very fine, irregular,"" which does not match the specific forms mentioned in the ground truth."
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,In the middle.,False
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Halving or quartering.,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Julienning"", but the LLM answer is ""Halving or quartering"", which does not align with the ground truth. Julienning is a cutting technique that involves cutting ingredients into thin strips, which is often done before cubing. Halving or quartering, on the other hand, involves cutting an ingredient into larger pieces, which may not be a necessary step before cubing."
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,True
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,The input is a **whole** fruit or vegetable.,"False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the input form is a ""stripe"", but the LLM answer states that the input is a ""whole"" fruit or vegetable."
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,"Cubing results in **uniform, square-shaped pieces**. The amount depends on the size of the original fruit or vegetable and the desired cube size.","False

"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Washing.,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Julienning"", which implies that the other cutting task that should be executed before is likely ""peeling"" (as in, peeling before julienning). The LLM answer ""Washing"" is a separate task that may be performed before chopping, but it is not directly related to the specific cutting task of julienning."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" because making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made. The ground truth does not specify that only one cut can be made, so both ""exactly one"" and ""more than one"" are compatible with ""at least 1""."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,"The input is the **whole, unchopped fruit or vegetable**.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which is ""Stripe"". The LLM answer describes the state of the object being chopped, whereas the ground truth suggests a specific form or pattern (""Stripe"") of the input."
